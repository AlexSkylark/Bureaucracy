**A Mod to make Kerbal Space Program a little closer to a tycoon simulator**

**Overview**

A monthly budget is allocated based on your space programs Reputation.  Kerbals need to be paid, and Facilities have a maintenance cost.

Once costs have been paid, whatever is left is split between 3 departments, “Budget”, “Facilities/Construction” and “Research”

“Budget” department is basically your rocket building money. Facility Upgrades are handled by the construction department, and the Research Department analyse science that has been returned. 

Contract funding is replaced with Reputation which feeds into the budget that is allocated to you every month.

Kerbals who die on mission will have a negative effect on your reputation. Too many deaths may also cause Kerbals to quit your space program (see Wiki for more details).
 

**Facilities/Construction**

You no longer need to have the available funds on hand to upgrade a building. Instead, the upgrade is handled by the Construction Department (see wiki for more info)

 
If there isn’t enough money to cover the Facility Maintenance costs, a facility can be “closed” (functionality reduced/see wiki for more details).


**Research**

When science data is returned to the Space Centre, you will not get the science given to you straight away. First it must be analysed by the Research Department (see wiki).

 
**Crew**
 
Crew now have a basic “morale” system. Annoy your kerbals too much, and they will quit (see wiki).
 
New recruits must be trained. You will not be able to use new recruits for one budget cycle while they go through training.

 
**Events**

Random events will occasionally happen that may effect your space programs funding, science output or put a kerbal back into training.
