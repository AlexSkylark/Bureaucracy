{
    showChangelog = True
    modName = Bureaucracy

    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.1.2
        change = Fixed issue where accidentally activating the Facilty Upgrade cancellation dialog would reset upgrade progress to 0.
        change = Fixed Facility Upgrade dialog showing incorrect amount to be lost on cancellation.
    }

    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.1.1
        change = Fixed issue where "incremental progress" would try and catch up from Y1 D1 the first time the mod is loaded. The fix is retroactive, so you may see this bug one more time when launching the save after upgrading.
    }

    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.1
        change = Reworked Science/Construction rewards. Rewards will now be allocated gradually throughout the month, rather than all at once (roughly once a day, but this can vary at high timewarp).
        change = Construction/Research Budgets are now locked in until the next month (ie Allocation Rate changes will only be taken into account at the end of the month)
        change = Existing saves will set the first months allocations up based on the state the save is loaded in.
        change = New saves will assume "Starting Funds" is this months budget.
        change = Added missing "HandleScience" toggle to settings.
        change = Save Upgrade Pipeline updated to facilitate upgrades from 0.2+ > 1.1. If you happen to be using the VERY FIRST beta, your settings will be reset.
        change = Allocation Screen will now show effect of your allocations (for next month) in real time.
        change = Research UI "Maximum Output" label now reflects this months output rather than changing with allocation.
        change = Construction UI will now show total investment waiting to be used for this month.
    }
}
