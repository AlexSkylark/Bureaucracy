    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.1
        change = Reworked Science/Construction rewards. Rewards will now be allocated gradually throughout the month, rather than all at once (roughly once a day, but this can vary at high timewarp).
        change = Construction/Research Budgets are now locked in until the next month (ie Allocation Rate changes will only be taken into account at the end of the month)
        change = Existing saves will set the first months allocations up based on the state the save is loaded in.
        change = New saves will assume "Starting Funds" is this months budget.
        change = Added missing "HandleScience" toggle to settings.
        change = Save Upgrade Pipeline updated to facilitate upgrades from 0.2+ > 1.1. If you happen to be using the VERY FIRST beta, your settings will be reset.
        change = Allocation Screen will now show effect of your allocations (for next month) in real time.
        change = Research UI "Maximum Output" label now reflects this months output rather than changing with allocation.
        change = Construction UI will now show total investment waiting to be used for this month.
    }
